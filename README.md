# Basic-Keylogger
This is a simple keylogger that I made using python. I tried to make one in batch or vbs, but it is practically impossible. So I had to use python.
<br>
Double click on Run.vbs after downloading the files and the program will start automatically.<br> When you want to stop logging, open up task manager and kill winupdate.exe. Then open up keyloggeroutput.txt, and you will see that all the characters that you have typed are logged.
